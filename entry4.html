        <p class="pt-sans-narrow-regular">The Red Cube by Isamu Noguchi, installed in 1968 in front of 140 Broadway in New York City's Financial District, is a bold geometric sculpture that contrasts sharply with the surrounding architecture. The 28-foot-tall steel cube, painted in vibrant red and tilted on one corner, creates a sense of balance and tension, drawing viewers into its playful yet minimalist form. A circular hole in the center adds visual depth, offering a unique perspective of the buildings behind it. Noguchiâ€™s work reflects his interest in merging art with public spaces, and the Red Cube remains an enduring symbol of abstraction and modernism within the urban landscape.</p>
