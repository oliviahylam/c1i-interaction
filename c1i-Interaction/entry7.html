        <p class="pt-sans-narrow-regular">The Sphere by Fritz Koenig, created in 1971, originally stood at the center of the World Trade Center plaza as a symbol of global peace through trade. Remarkably, the 25-foot-tall bronze sculpture survived the 9/11 attacks, becoming an emblem of resilience amidst the tragedy. After being recovered from the rubble, the damaged Sphere was relocated to Battery Park in 2002 as a memorial to honor the victims and the spirit of recovery. Its battered surface serves as a poignant reminder of the events of that day, transforming the artwork from a symbol of commerce to one of hope, endurance, and remembrance.</p>
