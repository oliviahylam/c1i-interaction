        <p class="pt-sans-narrow-regular">The Statue of Liberty, located on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, is one of the most iconic symbols of freedom and democracy in the United States. Designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and gifted to the United States from France in 1886, the statue represents Libertas, the Roman goddess of liberty. Standing 305 feet tall from base to torch, it holds a torch in its right hand and a tablet inscribed with the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence in its left. The statue serves as a welcoming symbol to immigrants arriving by sea and a lasting emblem of hope and opportunity.</p>
