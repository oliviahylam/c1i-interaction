        <p class="pt-sans-narrow-regular">The Oculus, designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, is a striking structure located at the World Trade Center Transportation Hub in New York City. Completed in 2016, it serves as a major transit station and retail complex. With its soaring, wing-like design, the Oculus symbolizes a bird taking flight, representing hope and renewal after the September 11 attacks. The building features a vast white, ribbed interior flooded with natural light, creating a sense of openness and tranquility. The innovative architecture and symbolic form make it both a functional transportation hub and a celebrated piece of modern art and design.</p>
