        <p class="pt-sans-narrow-regular">The Charging Bull by Arturo Di Modica, installed in 1989 in Bowling Green, is a powerful symbol of financial optimism and resilience. Created as a guerrilla artwork, the 7,100-pound bronze sculpture was placed without permission near the New York Stock Exchange following the 1987 market crash, embodying the strength and determination of the American economy. Depicting a bull mid-charge, it has become a popular attraction and photo spot, representing prosperity and ambition. Though initially removed by authorities, public demand secured its permanent installation in the Financial District. Today, the Charging Bull remains an iconic symbol of Wall Street and New York's enduring economic spirit.</p>
