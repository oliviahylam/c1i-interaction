        <p class="pt-sans-narrow-regular">The Vessel, designed by Thomas Heatherwick and opened in 2019 at Hudson Yards, is a striking honeycomb-like structure composed of 154 interconnected staircases, offering visitors a unique way to experience views of the city. Inspired by ancient stepwells in India, its intricate design invites exploration, blending art, architecture, and public interaction. Standing 16 stories high, the Vessel quickly became a popular attraction and photo spot. However, safety concerns led to restricted access in 2021, limiting public use. Despite challenges, it remains a distinctive piece of urban art, symbolizing the transformation of Hudson Yards into a cultural and architectural landmark.</p>
